R3. Source Port y, Destination Port x
R4. To allow a specific rate of transfer required for an app, or to keep direct and 
connectionless.
R5. So it can be ACK'd for secure connections.  With UDP there is no handshake so another 
person could just connect and disrupt the VoIP.  The UDP is also unreliable, connectionless, 
meaning latency is a problem.
R7. Yes, it will be demultiplexed and identified from their idividual IP addresses.
R8. They are being sent through the same socket, but de multiplexed to process in two different 
parts of the application layer.
P1. a. 11337 to 23, b. 12345 to 23, c. 23 to 11337, d. 23 to 12345, e. yes, f. no
P3. 01010011
    01100110
    --------
    10111001
    01110100
    --------
    00101110
    vvvvvvvv
    11010001
It's very possible a 1 bit error can evade detection, but a 2 bit error cannot.
P5. No, some addition errors can still lead to proper 1's.
P6. If the sender recieves a zero, there's no way a one can be sent to the reciever or
