Networking Homework 1

R1. A host and end system both run applications that can send and recieve data packets  
They both often will store data as well.  What can make an end system and host different 
is that end systems are first and formost, at the Internet's edge.  They are where the 
point A and B are for packet transfer.  However, a host can do all of those things and can 
act intermediately as a point C between point A and B.  Servers and cilents are two types 
of hosts, one extending from a personal computer, while the latter can be an end point or 
transfer point.  For example, when a person logs into a Minecraft server, they haave to 
pass through other servers to reach the playable world.  First, they log into the cilent 
on their host machine, then that login is processed by the Minecraft Authentation servers, 
and then again pass through that system automatically when routing to a Minecraft server, 
hosted by someone else either on their host machine, or an indepedent server.

With that logic in mind, a web server, assuming this means a web page, is an end system.  
If this web server functions as say, a login portal and a log in is processed, then no, it 
is a host.

R4. Home Access: DSL, Cable, FTTH, Satellite
    Enterprise Access: Ethernet, WiFi

R9. DSL: 12 - 24 Mbps down, 1.8 - 2.5 Mbps up, shared via phone lines
    ftth: Potential rates of 1Gbps+ most offered average via companies is 20Mbps,     
    dedicated via a splitter system
    Dial-Up: 56 Kbps, shared via phone line
    HFC: With one device up to 42.8 Mbps down and 30.7 Mbps up, dedicated via seperate     
    wire types

R10. Wifi, which uses a special access point maybe from 1 to 10 to possibly 100 meters 
away, gives all devices a higher rate on par with Ethernet, around 100 Mbps.  3G and LTE 
are wide access area wireless systems that can reach several 10s of kilometers away.  3G 
can get speeds up to 1 Mbps, while LTE can get up to 10 Mbps.
