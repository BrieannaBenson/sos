Networking Homework 7

R7. Because a deep copy would imply only one or the other has access to it at a time.  All input ports 
have the most recent modification to their local table so they can do back and forth routing.
R16. Assuming standard 20 byte header messages, half of the packet will be header and half will be 
data.
P3. The VC table has a a column for incoming and outgoing interfaces, as well as the VC session ID.  
Datagram tables only bother with forwarding based on IP packets, through the first few differing sets 
of bits.
P4. 
P7. No, Yes, No
P10.

5 entries were required, even if technically this is four distinct possiblities.  
You could just say the final one covers anything that starts with zero or in general doesn't fit, 
0 handles the 111 starting prefixes that bleed into the second bytefor anything that doesn't have 1 
in the tenth down bit.  For those that do, it must be divided into two catogoires,, one with the last 
two byte' range, and the other guiding what is left up until the 6th bit needs to be flipped.
