R3. The cilent is the one that requests or contacts, while the server waits and then sends data.
R5. IP Address

R9. Transport layer.  The programmer needs to understand how to encrypt data.
R11. So the connection is reliible with so much traffic.
R13. Web caching makes it easier to retrieve pages that have already been visited by the user.  It also stores input data 

that is useful for signing into a server.  However, not all of the local copies save time, because for webpages with 

embedded video for example, they need a constant connection to the server anyway, for updates.  Similarly, a webpage may 

need to be retrieved again if it has been modified.
R15. FTP uses control connections, which go right to another end system directly, rather than through most of the network.
